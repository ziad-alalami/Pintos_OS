			 MEMORY MAPPED FILES
			 ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

struct mmap_entry {
	struct list_elem list_elem;
	struct vm_entry* vme;
	int id;
	struct file* file;
};

Used to keep track of a page mapped by mmap. A list of these is now stored in each thread.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> C2: Describe how memory mapped files integrate into your virtual
>> memory subsystem.  Explain how the page fault and eviction
>> processes differ between swap pages and other pages.

When mmap is called for a given address, we mark the associated page in our supplemental page table as full, as well as any adjacent pages needed to fit the file size. These entries are given their own references to the mapped file, and some other metadata. We also add a new mmap_entry to the list within the current thread, and return an ID that is the memory address mapped to.

When an address is unmapped, we scan through the current thread's mmap_entry list, processing any entries that match the unmapped ID. Any such entries are removed from the list, and the data at the associated virtual address is written back to the file in the proper location if the dirty bit is set. Additionally, we process all remaining mmap_entry's when the current thread exits.

The page fault behavior is similar to data demand-paged from executables. We have a file pointer in the vm_entry, as well as the number of read_bytes and zero_bytes. When a page fault occurs, we lazily load read_bytes into that page.

The eviction behavior does not behave specially.

>> C3: Explain how you determine whether a new file mapping overlaps
>> any existing segment.

Before performing the mapping, we do a few checks. First, we check if the address we are attempting to map to is after the data/code segments of the process. Then, we check if the last address to be mapped is before the max stack value (which we have hard-coded). Finally, for the given address and every additional address that needs to be mapped (increasing by the size of one page until we have enough space for the whole file) we check that these addresses are free to be used in our supplemental page table.
---- RATIONALE ----

>> C4: Mappings created with "mmap" have similar semantics to those of

>> the two situations.

We chose to share most of the implementation with data demand-paged from executables, as we figured it was best to avoid duplciating logic. As such, we re-used the file pointer, read_bytes, and zero_bytes already in the vm_entry, as well as the same page fault handling logic.

The extra need of the mmap mappings being written to file was handled by the mmap_entry list in each thread, which handles writing to file upon munmap calls or if the thread exits.

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.
